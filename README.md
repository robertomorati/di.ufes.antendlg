Authoring Environment for Location Decision Games. Brief Description: In order to contribute for the creation of opportunities to promote making decisions (development of decision-making skills), this thesis presents an environment to allow the construction of a specific class of locative games, that we call LDG (Location Decision Games). LDG are games where elements of the real world and its characteristics make up the game scenario using GPS (Global Positioning System). Allows the inclusion of elements of the virtual world in the real world, hence the players can visualize this in mobile device. Besides, allowing the interaction between players could be with naturally. In this way, compounding scenarios and situations that react with the positions of the players. This environment is composed by editors with the purpose of enabling the construction of the Location Decision Games (LDG). Finally, this environment was developed with Django Python, Bootstrap, API version 3 of Google Maps, based on HTML 5 and REST Framework.
